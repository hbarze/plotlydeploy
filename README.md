Module 12 Challenge

## Overview: 
Using Javascript, JSON, and html files, the goal is to create an interactive dashboard that displays Belly Button Diversity charts and information. This information is made public using github pages. 
Identifying the top 10 bacterial species was key in the research to help discover species of bacteria to aid in the manufacturing of synthetic beef. 

## Deliverables:
* Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

* Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

A person visiting the website nees to be able to select unique ID's from a drop down menu to explore the data, and the dashboard needs to be public and easily accessible.
